      "- The purpose is to build lessons and distribute across different Computer Science sections (CSSE, CSP, CSA), a pathway that covers 3 years of High School Instruction.\n",
      "- The primary languages and frameworks that are taught are `JavaScript/HTML/CSS`, `Python/Flask`, `Java/Spring`.  Read below for more details.\n",

      "Deployment Cycle.  In the deplopyment cycle, `sync-github-action-review`, it is a requirement to complete the development cycle prior to doing a VSCode `sync`.
