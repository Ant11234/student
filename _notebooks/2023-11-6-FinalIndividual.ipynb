    "# Trimester 1 Reflection\n",
    "- Period 1 CSA has been one of my most memorable classes I've had during my time at Del Norte. Throughout this trimester, I feel as if I've made some close friends in my teamates, and have grown a lot and learned a lot especially in respect to computer science. While coming into this class I was expecting my previous knowledge in python to help considerably, and I believed that my previous experiences working on collaborative projects like in my AI research paper would make this class easy. I was mistaken. Even though this knowledge definently made a considerable impact. I was initially overwelmed with work trying to learn a new language and complete tons of dev ops stuff. However, after getting into the groove of it, I wouldn't have it any other way. The challenge this class has provided me has propelled my computer science knowledge, and I feel much more well versed and comftorable despite majority of this being new. I feel as if in this short time I have learned and progressed further than I ever thought I would. I am pleasently suprised by the drastic effect this class has had on my ability in computer science, and its ability to reignit my love for computer science. In future trimesters I hope to recieve a similar challenge in order to come out a more proficient coder and keep kindiling my passion for computer science."
